# MAGIC ### What is a webhook?
# MAGIC A webhook will call a web URL whenever a given event occurs. In our case, that's when a model is updated or deployed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC __A primary goal with MLOps is to introduce more robust testing and automation into how we deploy machine learning models.__  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To aid in this effort, the MLflow Model Registry supports webhooks that are triggered during the following events in the lifecycle of a model. This will allow us to automatically:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Perform general validation checks and tests on any model added to the Registry
# MAGIC * Send notification / slack alert when a new model is updated
# MAGIC * Introducing a new model to acccept traffic for A/B testing
# MAGIC * ...
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Webhooks are available through the Databricks REST API or the Python client databricks-registry-webhooks on PyPI.

# MAGIC ### Types of webhooks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are two types of webhooks based on their trigger targets:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Webhooks with HTTP endpoints (HTTP registry webhooks): Send triggers to an HTTP endpoint.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Webhooks with job triggers (job registry webhooks): Trigger a job in a Databricks workspace.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are also two types of webhooks based on their scope, with different access control requirements:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Model-specific webhooks: The webhook applies to a specific registered model. You must have Can Manage permissions on the registered model to create, modify, delete, or test model-specific webhooks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Registry-wide webhooks: The webhook is triggered by events on any registered model in the workspace, including the creation of a new registered model. To create a registry-wide webhook, omit the model_name field on creation. You must have workspace admin permissions to create, modify, delete, or test registry-wide webhooks.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Webhook Supported events
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_CREATED: A new model version was created for the associated model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_TRANSITIONED_STAGE: A model version’s stage was changed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * TRANSITION_REQUEST_CREATED: A user requested a model version’s stage be transitioned.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * COMMENT_CREATED: A user wrote a comment on a registered model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * REGISTERED_MODEL_CREATED: A new registered model was created. This event type can only be specified for a registry-wide webhook, which can be created by not specifying a model name in the create request.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_TAG_SET: A user set a tag on the model version.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_TRANSITIONED_TO_STAGING: A model version was transitioned to staging.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_TRANSITIONED_TO_PRODUCTION: A model version was transitioned to production.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * MODEL_VERSION_TRANSITIONED_TO_ARCHIVED: A model version was archived.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * TRANSITION_REQUEST_TO_STAGING_CREATED: A user requested a model version be transitioned to staging.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * TRANSITION_REQUEST_TO_PRODUCTION_CREATED: A user requested a model version be transitioned to production.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * TRANSITION_REQUEST_TO_ARCHIVED_CREATED: A user requested a model version be archived.
